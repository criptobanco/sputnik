# Bitcoin Buy/Sell Widget

## Simple embeddable widget for your website

Many users don't care about the fact that CriptoBanco's exchange is backed by a highly-scalable continuous double-auction exchange platform. All they care about is that they want to buy or sell bitcoins or bitcoin-denominated derivatives, and they want to know at what price they can trade those products.

Our embeddable widget gives you the power to put a very simple buy or sell interface on any web page. It dynamically updates the price at which the user can buy or sell, taking into account both the available liquidity and the user's desired trade size. The user doesn't need to concern themselves with the order book, they can just trade.
